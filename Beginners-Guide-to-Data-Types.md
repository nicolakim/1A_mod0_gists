### Strings
1. A **string** is a **data type** used to represent text.  
2. **Strings** can contain alphabet characters _in addition to_ spaces, numbers, and special characters.  
3. Strings are a sequence of characters and are written in quotation marks in code. 

### Integers
* An **integer** is a whole number.  
* Integers can be positive, negative, or zero, and are never a fraction.
* Integers cannot have decimal places.
* Integers are numbers such as 999, 36, 1, 0. 

### Floats
* **Floating** point numbers are numbers that contain floating decimal points.  
+ They can be positive or negative.  
- Floats are numbers such as 3.2, -99.8, 0.5.

### Boolean
* A **boolean** value is either _true or false_. 
* Boolean values are used in boolean logic, which is a subset of algebra used for creating true/false statements

### Array
> An **array** is a data structure that represents a group of things.
> It is an ordered, indexed collection of data in a row and each one is numbered starting from zero.

**Arrays** are written in square brackets `"[data type one, data type two, data type three]"` in code.  

### Syntax
**Syntax** is the way we write, it is the _set of rules_ that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.  

### Class
A **class** is a _category_ of thing.  

### Hash
* A **hash** is a type of class, and it is a collection of key value pairs.  
* A hash differs to an array as you can assign any object to refer to the data value (instead of numbered like an array).

```
options = { :font_size => 10, :font_family => "Arial" }
```
It can also be written as:

```
options = { font_size: 10, font_family: "Arial" }
```

### Attribute
An **attribute** of a class is a _characteristic_ that every instance of that class has.
* For example:  
Each car (class) has a manufacturer, model name, and paint colour (attributes).  
Each coffee (class) has a roast date, brew type, and notes (attributes).

### Instance
An **instance** is an occurrence or version of any object.

### Methods
A **method** is how is a function or procedure associated with a message and an object, and how it behaves.
