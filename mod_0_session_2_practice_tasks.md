# Session 2 Practice Tasks

The assignments listed here should take you approximately 55 total minutes.


### 1. Creating Files and Directories (10 min)

_Need help? You can go back to the files/directories portion of the lesson [here](http://mod0.turing.io/session2/#filesdirectories)._

Scroll down to the bottom of this page and look at the image of the directories and files. Use commands in your terminal to create the directories and files structured exactly how they appear in the image. 

When you're done, type `history` to see your commands. Copy and paste the commands that were used to create the directory and files:

```
    pwd
    mkdir session_3_practice
    ls
    cd session_3_practice
    touch budget.csv
    ls
    touch mentors.txt
    ls
    mkdir notes
    ls
    mkdir practice
    ls
    cd notes
    touch git_notes.txt
    ls
    touch command_line_notes.txt
    ls
    cd
    pwd
    cd session_3_practice
    cd practice
    ls
    touch git_practice.txt
    ls
    mkdir projects
    cd projects
    touch game.js
    cd
    history
```

Since this is just a practice directory, feel free to remove the parent directory `session_3_practice` when you're done with this exercise. 

### 2. Git Practice (15 min)

_You can reference the files/directories portion of the lesson [here](http://mod0.turing.io/session3/#git)._

Follow the steps below to practice the git workflow. Be ready to copy-paste your terminal output as confirmation of your practice. 

1. Create a directory called `git_homework`. Inside of there, create a file called `quotes.txt`. 
1. Initialize the directory
1. Check the git status 
1. Add your `quotes.txt` file to the staging area
1. Check the git status
1. Create an initial commit
1. Check the status
1. Add your favorite quote to the `quotes.txt` file
1. Check the status
1. Check the diff
1. Add the changes to the staging area
1. Commit the new changes
1. Check the status
1. Show the log in oneline (yes, `oneline`, not a spelling error) format

Copy and paste **all** of the terminal text from this process below (not just the history):

```
nic~$ ls
Applications	Documents	Library		Music		Public
Desktop		Downloads	Movies		Pictures
nic~$ mkdir git_homework
nic~$ cd git_homework
nic~/git_homework$ touch quotes.txt
nic~/git_homework$ ls

nic~/git_homework$ git status

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	quotes.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
nic~/git_homework$ git add quotes.txt
nic~/git_homework$ git status

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   quotes.txt

nic~/git_homework$ git commit -m "Adding new quotes file"

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   quotes.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
nic~/git_homework[master !]$ git diff quotes.txt
diff --git a/quotes.txt b/quotes.txt

nic~/git_homework[master]$ cd
```

**IMPORTANT**: Do not remove this `git_homework` directory. You will be using this directory during Thursday's session. 

### 3. Classes, Attributes, and Methods (15 min)

Look at the template below for a `CardboardBox` class. Fill in missing blanks with additional attributes and methods.

Class: CardboardBox

Attributes:
- width (integer)
- depth (integer)
- colour (string)
- weight_capacity (integer)

Methods:
- break_down
- stack
- store
- exceeding_weight?

### 4. Modify your Bash Profile (10 min)

- Make sure that you're shell is set to bash by running the following command: `$ chsh -s /bin/bash`. Remember to omit the `$`!

- [ ] Watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s_CDBnxHSA0HDWldjosulthAvBi-C-d5/view?usp=sharing) and follow each step to modify your own bash profile. As mentioned in the video, you will need this snippet below:

```
# get current branch in git repo
function parse_git_branch() {
  BRANCH=`git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/\1/'`
  if [ ! "${BRANCH}" == "" ]
  then
    STAT=`parse_git_dirty`
    echo "[${BRANCH}${STAT}]"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}

# get current status of git repo
function parse_git_dirty {
  status=`git status 2>&1 | tee`
  dirty=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "modified:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  untracked=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "Untracked files" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  ahead=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "Your branch is ahead of" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  newfile=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "new file:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  renamed=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "renamed:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  deleted=`echo -n "${status}" 2> /dev/null | grep "deleted:" &> /dev/null; echo "$?"`
  bits=''
  if [ "${renamed}" == "0" ]; then
    bits=">${bits}"
  fi
  if [ "${ahead}" == "0" ]; then
    bits="*${bits}"
  fi
  if [ "${newfile}" == "0" ]; then
    bits="+${bits}"
  fi
  if [ "${untracked}" == "0" ]; then
    bits="?${bits}"
  fi
  if [ "${deleted}" == "0" ]; then
    bits="x${bits}"
  fi
  if [ "${dirty}" == "0" ]; then
    bits="!${bits}"
  fi
  if [ ! "${bits}" == "" ]; then
    echo " ${bits}"
  else
    echo ""
  fi
}

export PS1="\u\w\`parse_git_branch\`$ "
```

### 5. Questions/Comments/Confusions

If you have any questions, comments, or confusions that you would an instructor to address, list them below:

1. Please let me know any feedback, thank you!

### Extensions

1. If time permits and you want extra git practice and alternative explanations (it's often beneficial to have something explained in many different ways), check out [Codecademy's Git Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git), particularly the first free item on the syllabus, "Basic Git Workflow". In Mod 0, we will not cover anything beyond Codecademy's intro section; however, you are welcome to check out the other git lessons listed on the syllabus if you want a head start. 

1. [This course](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendixa.html) is how I personally learned command line. If time permits, I highly recommend reading and practicing. 

1. Also recommended by Jeff Casimir: [Michael Hartl's Learn Enough Command Line](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial/basics).
