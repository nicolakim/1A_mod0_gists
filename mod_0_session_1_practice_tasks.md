Click the **Edit** button when you're ready to start adding your answers. To save your work, click the green button in the bottom right-hand corner. You can always come back and re-edit your gist. 

### 1. Documentation and Googling (20 min)

Documentation of a language, framework, or tool is the information that describes its functionality. For this part of the practice tasks, you're going to practice digging into documentation and other reference material. 

**NOTE:** Remember to look for the docs! mdn for javascript and ruby-doc for ruby.

- [ ] In your own words, what does the JavaScript/Ruby string split method do (pick based on your program)? As you're explaining, be sure to provide an example. Your answer:  
* In Ruby, the string split method allows us to divide the string by a value (delimiter) in to an array.  
* Note that the value (delimiter) is not included in the result. 
* An example would be  
```
"hello world".split
=> ["hello", "world"]
"hello world".split("o")
=> ["hell", " w", "rld"]
```

- [ ] What did you Google to help you with this task, and how did you pick your results?  
* I Googled 'string split method ruby-doc' and also '"string split" method function ruby-doc'. I was focussing on results from ruby-doc.org and I also read a post on stack overflow. I interpreted my answer from the ruby-doc result and I also used the book Learn to Program by Chris Pine. 

- [ ] In your own words, what does the JavaScript/Ruby array slice method do (pick based on your program)? As you're explaining, be sure to provide an example. Your answer:  
* The array slice method takes all the ordered data and allows us to cut in to an array and select specific elements. Slice also works as a string method.  
* Array structure assigns a numerical starting from zero for each value.  
* An example would be, an array of vegetables: 
`vegetables = ["carrot", "peas", "spinach", "squash", "onion"]`
`vegetables.slice(1)` in Ruby would provide the response of "peas", as "carrot" would be (0) and "spinach" would be 2.

- [ ] What did you Google to help you with this task, and how did you pick your results?  
* I originally googled 'ruby array slice method ruby-doc' and the first result was the ruby-doc site I used to understand more and read through the explanation. I also used the book Learn to Program by Chris Pine.

### 2. Data Types (20 min)

Imagine that you're taking your favorite board game and turning it into a computer-based game. 

- [ ] Name of board game: Scrabble

- [ ] Use the space below to categorize game data into each of the following data types. You should have a **minimum of two** pieces of data for each category. Try practicing variable assignment in this exercise.

1. String data: 
- Players Name (e.g. Joan, Bob, Julie)
- Words played each turn (e.g. cat, table, calendar)
1. Integer and/or float data: 
- Word count score per play (e.g. 3 points for the word cat, 6 points for the word table)
- Total points score for the game (e.g. 82, 41, 25)
1. Boolean data:
- Option to play the computer = t/f (e.g. Do you want to play against the computer?)
- Option to play again = t/f (e.g. Game over, do you want to play again?)
1. Array data:
- Player name and a list of all the words they played (e.g. Joan, window, sky, blackout, speaker)
- Player name and a list of the letter tiles they currently have (e.g. Bob, w, p ,m, y, o, a, e)
1. OPTIONAL: Hash or Object data:
- Players name and final scores (e.g. "Joan" => 132, "Bob" => 164, "Julie" => 195)


### 3. Markdown (20 min)
Markdown is the format all of your homework gists have been written in.

Using [this markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), create a new gist of your own by clicking the `New Gist` button in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Create a "Beginners Guide to data types" documenting your data types knowledge so far using Markdown. Incorporate each of the following features into your Gist: 

- at least two headings of different sizes
- at least one numbered list
- at least one bullet point list
- at least one bold word/phrase
- at least one italic word/phrase
- at least one code block
- at least one inline code block (greyed text)
- at least one image

- [ ] Paste the link to your gist here: [Nic Kim's gist link](https://gist.github.com/nicolakim/54d180e7049b1e1bbe98dd0bc81cbaee)

### 4. Questions/Comments/Confusions

If you have any questions, comments, or confusions from the any of the readings that you would like an instructor to address, list them below:

1. I'd welcome any feedback on terminology and vocabulary. Also I am aware I write in UK-English, will this be ok?
