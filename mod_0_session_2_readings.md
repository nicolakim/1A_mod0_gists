# Session 2 Readings and Responses

The readings and responses listed here should take you approximately 65 minutes total.

### <a href="https://medium.com/@sarambsimon/learning-fluency-672988a7ae52">Learning Fluency</a> by Turing alum Sara Simon (35 min)

- [ ] Your key take-aways **OR** how you're going to implement specific points (minimum 3):  

- It's important to **tune in to, and have an understanding of your best ways to learn**. Sara Simon talks about the advice of jumping in to a project and learning as you build wasn't the best way for her to learn, although it was the main advice experienced programmers (mostly males) within the industry advised her to learn.  
- **Build on small habits with focus and repetition.** Sara's experience of tingxie dictation, a 10 minute routine at the start of every day, for 8 weeks helped her build her vocabulary in a relatively short timeframe. Having discipline and repetition until it becomes muscle memory. This and also drills usually works well for me and is something I intend to build on personally.  
> "The disregard of rote memorization is a failure of imagination."  

- Being aware that everything learned in drills and through controlled habits won't always fully prepare for 'deep end' problems in the real world and having to troubleshoot and problem solve as we go. Having a foundation of skills and understanding in place are vital, but be prepared for **hands-on learning and trying things** without knowing if they will work.  
> "Study hard, study diligently, and every day you will see progress. With time, fluency works. With intention, it can work faster."
- **Through habit, repetition and memory we can build fluency.** We don't need to fully understand to build fluency, but through the process we can become fluent and _then_ build understanding.  
- People come from a huge variety of backgrounds, industries and experiences. They bring the skills learned from those backgrounds (empathy, context, creativity and many more skills) to STEM, a field where there’s always more to learn. **Keep evolving, learning and growing and applying life skills to your work.** 


### Slack Shortcuts and Features (10 min)

Use Google to go find at least one online resource detailing **keyboard shortcuts** and/or **features** that are built into Slack.

- [ ] What resource(s) did you find? Paste them below:

1. I used Google to search through Slack's help pages, in particular [this page](https://slack.com/help/articles/201374536-Slack-keyboard-shortcuts) helped me most.

- [ ] What are three Slack shortcuts and/or features that will contribute to your productivity? 

1. `Command ⌘ + K` (to search) 
2. `Command ⌘ + Shift ⇧ + K` (to open direct messages)
3. `Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧ + Up ↑` (Previous unread channel or DM) also `Option ⌥ + Shift ⇧ + Down ↓` (Next unread channel or DM)

I also like the shortcut for moving to the previous channel and to move forward to the next channel:
* `Command ⌘ + [` (to move back to previous channel) also `Command ⌘ + ]` (to move forward to next channel)

### [What's the use of the staging area in git?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49228209/whats-the-use-of-the-staging-area-in-git) on Stackoverflow (15 min)

The idea of the staging area is frequently one of the trickiest concepts to wrap your head around when you're first learning git. Read the question and answers (or do your own Googling on the git staging area). Then, create your own metaphor comparing the staging area to something in real life. 

- [ ] Type your metaphor below:  

The _git staging area_ is an extremely useful step as an assembly point to prepare for a commit. It's a way to run a final check to see everything is working and good to commit.  

The metaphor I like, is to think of a theatre stage performance:  
In rehearsals, this would be where the actors and actresses work on their performances. Making changes, updates, resolving issues and make edits to the look and feel of the production. There is still control. This would be the **working directory**.  
The final full dress rehearsals and back-stage areas, where the final set, sound, lights and props would be in place. The cast would be in full costume, hair and make up, and all the lines would be memorised ahead of the performance. Any final changes or issues would be checked here. This would be the **staging area**.  
The live performance to an audience would be the **repository**.

I found the explanation, further reading and image useful from [this website](https://git-scm.com/about/staging-area).
