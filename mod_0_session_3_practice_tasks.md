## Task 2: Forking a Repo on GitHub and Creating a Pull Request (30 min)

1. Fork the [Mod 0 Resources](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/mod0resources) repository. 
1. Open your terminal
1. Clone your fork to your computer (`git clone <url>`).
1. `cd` into your cloned repository.
1. Make a new file with the pattern `lastname_firstname_resources.md`.
1. Open the file you just created in your text editor.
1. Create a list of some of your favorite resources so far related to coding/Turing/git/GitHub/etc. These resources do not need to be ones that we've discussed in class. They can be *anything* that has helped you so far in your journey to learn software development.
1. Add your changes.
1. Commit your changes with a properly formatted commit message.
1. Push your changes to your fork.

**This next part is not something we discussed during Session 4 and will involve some figuring out on your own.** 

1. Use the `site:help.github.com` Googling trick to search GitHub's help area to figure out how to create a pull request from a fork. It may also be helpful to figure out what `pull request` means.
1. Open a pull request for your changes. 

- [ ] Once your pull request is open, you're done! You don't need to submit or paste anything since we will get a notification that you've opened a pull request.
