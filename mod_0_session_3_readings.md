# Session 3 Readings and Responses

The readings and responses listed here should take you approximately 35 minutes total.


## Assignment 1 (20 min)

Read David's [article on Git and GitHub](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/what-is-github)

- [ ] Use the article and outside resources (Google!) to describe the general process of a collaborative git workflow in the space below. 

**Git** is a version control system to track changes in our codebase over time. It’s beneficial as it means we never lose any work, it’s ubiquitous. It can be used offline.   
  
**GitHub** is a website for hosting these Git repositories (repos), projects tracked with Git. It’s beneficial as it means developers can share and collaborate on projects relating to the same codebase.  
  
Working locally on a codebase or project, when tracking with Git, commit messages and annotations are assigned to all commits a developer makes. All of this information is logged to the commit and once pushed to GitHub, it’s shared to the repository so it’s extremely clear and transparent. With Git, the whole repo is tracked at various points in time using these commits and shared to GitHub, so it’s possible to see a clear history of the project, and also travel back in that history.   
  
Working in a _collaborative workflow with version control is crucial for testing, bug fixes, enhancements and changes._ It is an **industry standard for developers**. Working collaboratively, this also means that developers can propose changes and ask for feedback or discussion from other developers working on the codebase or same project. These sessions are referred to as Code Review.  
  
> "GitHub is by far the most popular Git repository hosting service. As of October 2018, there were 31 million users across the globe with over 96 million repositories."  
  
GitHub is very transparent in showing how developers work, if their work is set to public, you can check a developer’s competency at Git, programming, and writing technical documentation through being an active Git and GitHub user. As a developer, you can also sign your commits with the use of a security key, to authenticate and verify your work.

_I enjoyed David's article on Coursereport.com and also enjoyed reading about branching on this [GitHub flow guide](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)._  

## Assignment 2: OOP and Bottles (12 min)

- [ ] Watch [this video](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wtlcsYrfk7bO975KxJhTqAfU9une7Pb8). Then choose your own real-world class and objects of that class. In the space below, define and name the **attributes** and **methods** for your class and the associated objects.  

#### _A reminder of definitions:_  
* **Class** - a class is a category of thing.
* **Attributes** - attributes of a class are characteristics that every instance of that class has.
* **Methods** - are written as verbs, usually action words or short action phrases and defines behaviour/actions.  
* **Instances** - an instance is an occurrence or version of any object.

| **Terminology**  | **Real world e.g.**         | **Data Type** |
| ---------------- |:---------------------------:| ------------- |
| _Class_          |   Plant                     |               | 
| _Attribute_      |   type_of_leaves            | String data   |  
| _Attribute_      |   hours_of_sunlight         | Integer data  |  
| _Attribute_      |   water_frequency           | Integer data  | 
| _Attribute_      |   flowering_plant           | Boolean data  |  
| _Attribute_      |   indoor_only               | Boolean data  |  
| _Method_         |   watering                  |               |  
| _Method_         |   positioning_for_sunlight  |               | 
| _Method_         |   pruning                   |               | 
| _Instances_      |   Shrub                     |               | 
| _Instances_      |   Fern                      |               | 
| _Instances_      |   Conifer                   |               |
